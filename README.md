# 📚 Tuition Website (Frontend Demo)

This is a frontend-only website project originally created for a local tuition center. Although the full project was later discontinued, I completed the homepage structure with a responsive navigation bar and developed fully functional **Contact Us** and **Address** pages.

### 🔗 Pages Included:
- Home (Header + Navbar)
- About Us (Coming Soon)
- Courses (Coming Soon)
- Achievers (Coming Soon)
- Admission (Coming Soon)
- **Contact Us** ✅
- **Address** ✅

### 🧩 Features:
- Responsive navigation bar
- Clean HTML/CSS structure
- Simple and readable layout
- Fully working links between pages

⚠️ **Note**: This is a partial project and does not include backend or full content — it was cancelled midway.
